#### Team Leader

2011 â†’ 2019

I was leading the Online Examination Team since 2017. We developed three different software with Laravel and Vue through the years. All software is used by our schools and universities. They can handle multiple types of questions including multiple-choice, drag-drop text or images, etc. Also, they can handle open-ended questions. The software is able to manage over 15 K people at the same time.

I developed Tercih.tv at Ubit. It is a very important tool to help students to decide to choose which university in TÃ¼rkiye's educational system. I used the Slim framework in this project and separate the UI/backend. I also developed an iOS mobile application for this project but it is not at the store right now.

After years I became team leader of the web part. I manage the team for 3 years. Our responsibility was to manage our university customers' website and integrate it to our software.
